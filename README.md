# BoundaryAware-CellSeg
A repository for implementing and refining bio-cell segmentation methods based on region growing with boundary constraints. The project integrates techniques like active contours, anisotropic diffusion (Perona-Malik), and gray-weighted distance transforms to ensure precise segmentation while preserving intercellular boundaries.
